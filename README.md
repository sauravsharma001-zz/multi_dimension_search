# **Mutli-Dimension Search  Implementation**
- Project Description
  Multi-dimensional search: Consider the web site of a seller like Amazon.  
  They carry tens of thousands of products, and each product has many
  attributes (Name, Size, Description, Keywords, Manufacturer, Price, etc.).  
  The search engine allows users to specify attributes of products that
  they are seeking, and shows products that have most of those
  attributes.  To make search efficient, the data is organized using
  appropriate data structures, such as balanced trees.  But, if products
  are organized by Name, how can search by price implemented efficiently?
  The solution, called indexing in databases, is to create a new set of
  references to the objects for each search field, and organize them to
  implement search operations on that field efficiently.  As the objects
  change, these access structures have to be kept consistent.
  
  In this project, each object has 3 attributes: id (long int), description
  (one or more long ints), and price (dollars and cents).  The following
  operations are supported:
  
     a. Insert(id,price,list): insert a new item whose description is given
        in the list.  If an entry with the same id already exists, then its
        description and price are replaced by the new values, unless list
        is null or empty, in which case, just the price is updated. 
        Returns 1 if the item is new, and 0 otherwise.
  
     b. Find(id): return price of item with given id (or 0, if not found).
  
     c. Delete(id): delete item from storage.  Returns the sum of the
        long ints that are in the description of the item deleted
        (or 0, if such an id did not exist).
  
     d. FindMinPrice(n): given a long int, find items whose description
        contains that number (exact match with one of the long ints in the
        item's description), and return lowest price of those items.
        Return 0 if there is no such item.
  
     e. FindMaxPrice(n): given a long int, find items whose description
        contains that number, and return highest price of those items.
        Return 0 if there is no such item.
  
     f. FindPriceRange(n,low,high): given a long int n, find the number
        of items whose description contains n, and in addition,
        their prices fall within the given range, [low, high].
  
     g. PriceHike(l,h,r): increase the price of every product, whose id is 
        in the range [l,h] by r%.  Discard any fractional pennies in the new 
        prices of items.  Note that you are truncating, not rounding.
        Returns the sum of the net increases of the prices.
  
     h. RemoveNames(id, list): Remove elements of list from the description of id.
        It is possible that some of the items in the list are not in the
        id's description.  Return the sum of the numbers that are actually
        deleted from the description of id.  Return 0 if there is no such id.
